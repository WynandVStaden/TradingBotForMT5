# MetaTrader 5 Advanced Trading Bot

This repository contains the source code for an advanced trading bot developed in MQL5 for MetaTrader 5. The bot implements a sophisticated trading strategy, incorporating features such as risk management, dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels, and partial position closure.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to use the trading bot in MetaTrader 5:

1. **Open MetaEditor:**
   - Go to the "Tools" menu in MetaTrader 5.
   - Click on "MetaQuotes Language Editor" or press `F4`.

2. **Create a New File:**
   - In MetaEditor, create a new file (`File -> New`), and then paste the code into this new file.

3. **Save the File:**
   - Save the file with an appropriate name and the extension `.mq5` (e.g., `AdvancedTradingBot.mq5`).

4. **Compile the Code:**
   - Press `F5` or click the "Compile" button to compile your code. Check the "Experts" tab at the bottom of the platform for any compilation errors.

5. **Move the Compiled File:**
   - Once successfully compiled, the compiled file (with the extension `.ex5`) will be created in the `MQL5/Experts` directory.
   - Move the compiled file (`AdvancedTradingBot.ex5`) to the `MQL5/Experts` directory in your MetaTrader 5 installation folder.

6. **Restart MetaTrader 5:**
   - Restart MetaTrader 5 to load the newly added Expert Advisor (EA). The EA should now appear in the "Navigator" panel under the "Expert Advisors" section.

7. **Enable Automated Trading:**
   - Ensure that automated trading is enabled. You can find this option in the upper toolbar of MetaTrader 5. It looks like a "Play" button.

8. **Drag and Drop:**
   - Drag and drop your Expert Advisor from the "Navigator" panel onto the chart where you want it to run.

## Important Notes

- Using trading bots involves risks. Understand the code, test it extensively in a simulated environment, and consider consulting with financial experts if needed.
- Be cautious when running trading bots on live accounts. Use proper risk management strategies.
